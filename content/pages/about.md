Hi, I'm Robin (thus <img class="h2" src="/assets/icons/grumpy-robin.svg"/>).
I'm an engineer, artist, and fabricator driven by a compulsion to learn, teach, and make.

My engineering work includes [software](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robingiese/),
[hardware](/posts/warm-and-fuzzy/thermostat-design-2), and [structural engineering / architecture](/portfolio/cottage).

My art includes [film](/posts/film%20making/home-body), [theater design](/posts/theater/the-odyssey), and music.

If there's anything you want made, [come find me](mailto:robin@grumpycorp.com).
My [grip truck](/posts/film%20making/grip-truck) is ready to roll anytime day or night.
