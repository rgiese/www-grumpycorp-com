## The Walnut Library

  <div class="accent-mono">

_February 2018_

The library invites readers of all ages to grab a book from its 288' (88m) of walnut shelving and enjoy it in the built-in nook or on the couch.
Recessed commercial/retail shelf standards get out of the way and make the space reconfigurable.
The lower cabinets include a thin LED strip to offer dim lighting when watching movies with built-in 7.1 surround sound.

One or more secret compartments may or may not have been provided.
