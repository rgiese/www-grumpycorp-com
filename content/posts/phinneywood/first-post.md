Grumpycorp Studios has purchased its first location!
Well, a location to turn into a sound stage. So we can stop filming on location. You get it. (And it will be a lot more than "just" a sound stage.)

We can't wait to share more about what we're up to, but that will need to be another day. Stay tuned!
