Hi, I'm Robin (thus <Icon sprite={GrumpyRobin} className="h2" />).
This site is about stuff I've explored and learned about starting from when I took a year off work to sort some things out.

GRUMPYCORP STUDIOS is the name of my movie studio
/ consulting company / record label / construction outfit, whatever I need it to
be at any given time.

If you want my help on anything - a project, a problem, an opportunity - don't hesitate to [ask](mailto:robin@grumpycorp.com).

### Ambitions

- In progress
  - Needlessly geek out with current technology
    - Automate my house's heating system into [IoT nirvana](/tags/posts/warm-and-fuzzy/)
  - Cook all the things _[(working on it)](/tags/posts/food/)_
- On ice
  - Become ~~a credible~~ any kind of film editor
    - Make a short film ([proof of concept](/posts/film%20making/nutella-thief/))
    - Make the soundtrack for said short film
    - Help friends make and edit films
- Completed
  - ~~Complete a major labor-of-love project~~ _[done](/portfolio/cottage/)_
    - ~~Design and build a~~ [writer's cottage](/tags/posts/cottage/) ~~in the back yard~~
  - ~~Figure out whether food could be a livelihood~~ been there, done it, doesn't pay

### Lessons learned

- _Just do it right the first time_ is the constant refrain from the [cottage](/tags/posts/cottage/) project, my primary occupation over the last eight months.
- Food is wonderful but don't make it a livelihood unless you enjoy it so much that you don't mind 60+ hour work weeks for minimum wage pay. Duh.
